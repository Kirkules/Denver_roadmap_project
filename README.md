This repository has code I (Kirk) wrote in R for a project in the 
"Privacy in Large Databases" class at the University of Denver in Fall 2015. 

Broadly, the goal of the project was to examine how to place trackers around a
road network to support the reconstruction of the path taken by trackable
agents during any given trip they take.

For example, a tracker may be a video camera that records timestamps when a given
car license plate passes by its location. If it's prohibitively expensive to place
these cameras at every intersection and to record and store all the corresponding
data, then you'd want to be able to choose the most useful subset of locations at
which to place trackers.

Our write-up describing the experiment and theory can be found [here](https://github.com/Kirkules/Denver_roadmap_project/blob/master/Privacy_Project_Final_Draft.pdf)

We worked on code separately for this project, and only really exchanged data files,
so I don't have the code written by the other group members.
